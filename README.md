# Encrypt Images With C ! #
I'm not great at C, so I wrote this to learn how to do it. I'm sure there are better ways to do this, but I wanted to see how it worked.

## Usage ##
- gcc main.c rnad.c -o {name of executable}
- cmd run {name of executable}
- Enter your two seed values (integers)
- Get your encrytped value
- WIP enter the file path of the image you want to encrypt
- WIP enter the file path of the image you want to decrypt

## Notes ##
- I'm not sure if this is the best way to do this, but it works.

Have fun with it, but please don't sue me if it doesn't work or you do something stupid with it. I'm not responsible for any damage that may occur.
